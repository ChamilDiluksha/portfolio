                Sysco, the largest food service company in the USA, was founded with the noble goal of "Connecting the
                world to share food and care for one another''. With more than 57,000 associates, 326 distribution centres
                across the globe, and more than 625,000 customer locations served, Sysco continues to be the industry
                leader in the selling, marketing, and distribution of food products to restaurants, healthcare, educational,
                and lodging facilities. The main concern is about providing fresh and high-quality productsto the world.
                From sourcing of food products, merchandising, storage and warehouse operations, order placement and
                pricing algorithms, to the delivery of food and supplies to Sysco’s global network, the in-restaurant dining
                experience of the end-customer, are the main flows to proceed. An operation as complex as this requires
                cutting-edge technology to ensure that this level of precision is achieved - and that's where we come in.
                
                We drive technology creation and management to transform an entire industry (Manage, Development,
                maintenance, and support for software applications used throughout Sysco’s value chain - from inbound
                logistics, storage, to outbound distribution.).

                  An integration layer that facilitates data transfer between Roadnet (Third party application to choose the 
                  best route to deliver the orders) and Sysco Unified System (SUS) is known as the American Routing 
                  Interface (ARI). Routers can proceed with routing by using the information it transmits from SUS to 
                  Roadnet about customers and orders. After routing is finished, ARI gets the routed order data from Roadnet 
                  and sends it back to SUS, allowing the warehouses to start proceeding with the orders. In addition, ARI 
                  makes it easier for routers to communicate with OREO (Order Release and Event Orchestration) via Kafka 
                  streams for pre-routing. This enables routers to complete routing tasks ahead of schedule, consuming data 
                  from the Customer Delivery Schedule stream to update delivery time schedules in Roadnet and publishing 
                  planned route data from Roadnet to a Kafka stream that ERoad (Third party application uses the routing 
                  data ) can access.

                  One service that connects to the Enterprise Roadnet (ERN) in the US and the UK is called the ERN adapter 
                  service. Connecting to Roadnet to send and receive orders and customers (locations) would be the primary 
                  use for this. A SOAP web service has been made available by Roadnet for external system communication. 
                  The EAS will function as a RESTful API, translating queries to the appropriate SOAP web service call (or 
                  calls) when necessary. When feasible, the EAS will additionally take care of the SOAP web service's 
                  constraints and enforce validations. This API will be used by downstream and upstream systems, like ARI, 
                  to perform activities against Roadnet.

                  Currently, the master of records for delivery days is Sysco Unified System (SUS), with Roadnet getting 
                  updated through American Routing Interface (ARI’s) customer download process. With the introduction of 
                  alternate holiday delivery schedules for customers, these alternate schedules were maintained in a separate 
                  application. To simplify customer maintenance, it was decided to also maintain the master delivery schedule 
                  within the Customer Delivery Schedule application. The routers would modify customer delivery days on 
                  the app, and it would feed the changes into a Kafka topic from which SUS and other downstream 
                  applications would subscribe to. For updating these records in Roadnet, there needs to be a consumer 
                  application that reads the changes from the CDS stream and publishes them to Roadnet. A consumer 
                  application that calls the ERN adapter service API can be used to achieve this.

                  The Roadnet Route Publisher is a service that retrieves published routes from Roadnet via the ERN Adapter

                  to a Kafka topic, which is then consumed by eRoad, a third-party application that utilizes routing

                  changes in quantity, line items, prices, and delivery dates through ARI to Roadnet.

                  Delivery Stop Attributes aims to capture issues when Sysco is in a customer location. Stop Attribute helps 
                  Sysco determine how much time it takes for delivery and obstacles driver face. This application will mainly 
                  collect survey results as customer attributes for each and every delivery stop via   a UI and predicted 
                  customer stop attributes generated by the  EATS AI model. The time taken for delivery depends not only 
                  on the status of the route but also on the status of the delivery location (stop). The stop attributes are used 
                  to capture the status of each stop. The goal of this system is to develop an enterprise system to merge and 
                  fortify stop attributes with human-added data and a data science model. This data should be able to be 
                  saved, edited, viewed, and sent to Blue Yonder automatically on a determined cadence.
